        <h1>VISION</h1>
        <p>We desire to see every Indian contribute 2% of their income to charities. As lack of transparency is one
            thing which stops most of us from contributing to NGOs. We are trying to address this problem using our
            innovative model. We believe that with the effective use of technology and introducing crowd-funding to the
            Indian public, we can create a much effective giving culture.</p>
